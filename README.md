# MongoDB with Async Python Course

[![](./readme_resources/mongodb-beanie-2x.jpg)](https://talkpython.fm/mongodb-async)



## Course Summary

MongoDB is one of the most exciting data technologies. You can build extremely high performance apps with the joy of a schemaless lifestyle. Python is the perfect counterpart to MongoDB. In this course, we feature the latest Python frameworks and techniques for working with MongoDB: The Beanie ODM (object-document mapper), Pydantic, FastAPI, Locust load testing, and Python's async and await capabilities.

## What will you learn?

In this course, you will:

- How document databases, such as MongoDB, work
- Where MongoDB fits in the larger scope of databases used in the world
- How to install and configure MongoDB and several management tools and GUIs
- A basic set of MongoDB's native shell commands and queries
- Foundational technologies such as Pydantic and Python's async and await
- How to design data models with Beanie and Pydantic
- Understand the tradeoffs when modeling data with documents
- Learn when it's a good idea (and when it's a bad one) to embed data within other records
- Use ORM-style programming with MongoDB and Beanie
- Use more efficient "in-place" operations such as addToSet with Beanie
- Design projection classes in Pydantic for improved performance
- How to safely store user accounts (namely passwords) in MongoDB
- To deeply integrate Beanie and MongoDB with FastAPI
- Create complex indexes in MongoDB from Beanie for 1000x performance boosts
- Use indexes to enforce data integrity in MongoDB
- Safely deploy MongoDB in a self-hosted environment within a cloud provider on multiple Linux machines
- Use the load testing framework Locust to probe and test the performance limits of your MongoDB-based web APIs
- And lots more

## Who is this course for?

For anyone who wants to use the latest Python technologies to work with MongoDB.

As for prerequisites, we assume:

- Basic familiarity with the Python programming language and core tools (e.g. pip)
- That you have very minimal understanding and experience with some database technology (relational or NoSQL)

The tools chosen and featured during this course are **100% free and most of them are open source** or have free and solid alternatives.
